Ok from try1 I got confused and still in the process of figuring this out.
This time I'll start from scratch with a different approach: trying to get something
to execute.

With some early successes I think I'll keep doing this. That is implement from the runtime up.

```
// sender: Lobby
// message: "+(2)"
// target: test
// slotContext: Object
test +(2)
```
