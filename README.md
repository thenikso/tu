# IO lang in Javascript

I came across the [IO language](https://iolanguage.org/) (from [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35207171))
and I'd like to give it a go to make it native to the browser.

There is already an attempt [here](https://github.com/dariusf/iota) but it's not
complete and it's not maintained.

I'd like to try this out to see if it can help me get ideas for Proma.

## Plan

- [ ] read all the [guide of IO](https://iolanguage.org/guide/guide.html) and understand it fully
- [ ] Parse with [OHM](https://ohmjs.org/editor/)
- [ ] First quick&dirty implementation
